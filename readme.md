Like using php to speed up developmemnt of html but don't run php on your desination server? 
This will do the job for you instead of manually renaming and using find/replace.

Rudementary scripts to (primarily) execute .php and capture output to .html files. 
Will also rename .php links inside the files and change them to .html.

Tested on OSX only.

## Usage:

In the directory containing your scripts, execute the script and it will batch convert all the files.
